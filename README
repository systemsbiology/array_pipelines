== Building the SproutCore UI for deployment

First, make sure you're using the latest SproutCore build tools from 
http://github.com/sproutit/sproutcore-abbot, and have the sc-build from
that in your path. Then, simply run:

rake build:ui

This will build the static UI files and then place them into your 
/server/public/static and /server/public/ui folders.

== Changes needed for new pipelines

  * Add a route in config/routes.rb
  * Add an action in app/controllers/ui_controller.rb
  * Add line in the Rakefile
